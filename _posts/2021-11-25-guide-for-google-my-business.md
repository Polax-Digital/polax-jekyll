Local SEO refers to techniques and actions aimed at increasing the organic visibility of [your website](https://polax.co.uk/blog/process-of-designing-a-website) in searches carried out in a particular geographic area.

In order to make the right decisions about local SEO, we must keep in mind two factors.

There are several reasons for this, but the most significant one is that nearly half of Google searches are local. The other one is that in recent years, mobile searches have increased.
