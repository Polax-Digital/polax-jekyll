The Internet has countless tools for positioning your business online. Corporate blogs are one of the easiest to use among all of these.

This allows you to position your products and services above those of your competitors when customers search for them on Google.

Here are our reasons for starting a blog and how it will help you generate content for your social networks in a more effective and strategic way.

### **You are in control of the user experience**

Social media is a great tool for sharing, connecting, inspiring, and educating. However, we do not own the platform.

If Mark Zuckerberg decides to leave the business and unplug everything (which is unlikely, but there have been plenty of system crashes in the past) **you wouldn't be able to connect with your audience**, and the wonderful things you created would be lost forever.

Having your own space where you can host content is key to getting people off social media and onto your [website](https://polax.co.uk/blog/why-you-need-a-website-for-your-business). Having control over the platform gives you the ability to create your own customer experience, quite the opposite of social networks where you have limited control.

Think about how you want your users to feel when they visit your page. What are your plans to connect with them beyond the post they are reading?

### **You position yourself as an expert in your niche**

When you are in control of the customer experience, and you develop highly-valuable content for your audience, using an effective strategy, you can connect with them on a more intimate level and present yourself as an expert, even though you may not have any services to offer.

When creating a content strategy, you can gradually integrate your offers, e-books, downloadables, and everything else relating to your offer and services in your posts in a subtle way, since it is likely that the person who reads that piece of content will want to dig deeper.

### **Stand out from your competitors**

Despite all the benefits we have just outlined, there are still many companies without a blog or website (yes, as hard as it may be to believe).

This becomes an advantage for your business, since you can fill the space that other companies decide to leave empty, achieving a better position among the companies in  that niche.

### **Reusable content for other social media**

One of our favourite reasons is this one. Instead of creating tons of content for social networks, which will then go uncontrollably down among your grid, we can reuse that last article for other platforms!

- You can create an Instagram post from an article, inviting people to visit your profile to read the full post.
- You can create a carousel to tell about the points you discussed in your post after a few weeks to rejuvenate it.
- Additionally, you can use quotes you have written to create Instagram quotes
- On Pinterest you can create two or three different graphics with the same name of the post and upload them so that they move organically.
- You can post the same graphics that you created on Instagram to Facebook and LinkedIn if you wish.

A well-written piece of content can be reused for a lot of benefits, allowing us to work more strategically without always creating new content.

### **Increase your visibility in search engines**

Search engines (Google and ... Google) assess relevance based on different factors, the majority of which are unknown; however, of all the criteria that are considered, quality and correctly-optimized content come first.

Due to this, if your blog produces content with these characteristics, it will help [increase your business' visibility](https://polax.co.uk/blog/tips-rank-better-google) because it will have a higher ranking in search engines.

### **Build an audience**

We build a reciprocal relationship through blogging. Readers "sympathize" with the blogger by providing relevant information.

In corporate blogs, this sympathy is shown through frequent visits, shared content, subscriptions to your email list, and purchases of your products.

### **You can become a teacher**

A major challenge for companies is to inform the audience about the importance of the product or service they are offering.

A corporate blog allows users to learn from the company itself everything about the product or service it offers; so that, to the extent that potential customers can learn about the product and understand its importance, their decision to purchase it will be easier.

Did this inspire you to start your own blog? The answer is yes, I hope!
