In order **for a business to succeed**, software solutions have become a necessity over the years.

As a business owner, you have two choices when it comes to software acquisition: select an off-the-shelf package made for the mass market or develop a solution that is tailored to your business' needs.

There are a surprising number of companies that do not invest in custom-made software to meet their specific needs, but instead buy off-the-shelf solutions.

You can provide your company with a platform for growth, development, and expansion when you decide to implement bespoke software solutions for your company.

In contrast to off-the-shelf software, bespoke software offers **many benefits for your organization**, including customization, security and scalability.

The following advantages will help you get a better understanding of custom software development before you decide to invest:

## Control

You own the software developed to your specifications, so you retain full control over it.

According to the growth of your business or the needs of your clients, you can easily implement new changes.

In addition, when you have complete control over your software solution, you are the one who can solve any issues that may arise and do not have to depend on third parties.

## Exclusivity

Wouldn't it be nice to have something that's specifically tailored to your business?

Designed to meet your specific needs, bespoke software is tailor-made for you and your business.

In an increasingly competitive industry, this gives [your business](https://polax.co.uk/blog/why-you-need-a-website-for-your-business) a competitive edge over businesses using generic and largely complex off-the-shelf software.

## Ownership

Owning the software as intellectual property can protect your business and give you complete control over the solution you develop.

This system is flexible enough to accommodate as many employees as you require, and there are no upgrade costs. Due to the fact that you own the product, you are not required to continue collaborating with any particular vendor.

Finally, if you are not satisfied with the service, you can easily find another software company to handle your solution.

## Maintenance

One of the greatest advantages of bespoke software is its [ease of maintenance](https://polax.co.uk/blog/website-maintenance-and-management).

Off-the-shelf software providers offer incremental improvements that are generic. This can prove frustrating if a user loses a feature they rely on, or when you submit a bug report.

After your product is ready to go live, a bespoke software development company guarantees to monitor the software and fix any bugs you report.

## Security

Software that is available off-the-shelf is susceptible to security breaches since it is widely used.

A common commercial package is constantly under threat, since encrypting a single system allows hackers to access information for a broad range of companies.

Typically, bespoke software is more difficult to hack since you have full control over it and no one else uses it. So, a hacker attack is less likely.

## Value for money

The initial cost can seem higher than that of off-the-shelf software, but in the long run the cost will be much lower since licensing, upgrades and subscription expenses are eliminated.

Bespoke software automates business processes by integrating the client's specific existing operations, resulting in further efficiency gains far beyond anything an off-the-shelf solution can achieve.

Implementing tailored software solutions can result in substantial savings that can be invested elsewhere in the business.

## Scalability & Flexibility

Compared to off-the-shelf software, bespoke software offers better scalability.

As your business grows or expands into other markets, an off-the-shelf solution may not be able to handle the demands, and you will have little or no say in how the system develops over time.
