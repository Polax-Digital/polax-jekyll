## #2 24/7 promotional tool

People need to be able to find you, and if you don't have a website, you're losing traffic through organic search and giving away potential customers to your competitors.

This also applies to social media, most of them work as a search engine with extra features, so you need to optimize your profile texts to reach an even bigger audience.

## #4 Differentiation from competitors

If you look through your niche competitors and their websites, you will quickly see that a lot of them probably share similar designs.

Or you can go opposite ways and differentiate yourself from your competitors by innovating with your website.

## #5 It helps you increase customer trust
