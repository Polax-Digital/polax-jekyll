Having access to free stock photos can save you from a lot of trouble. Photographs and images are key to the branding of any business.

An appropriate selection can enhance your image and reinforce the design of your visual identity, your communication, or your website.

Images and photos are key to conveying the essence of a project. Visual-focused brands have a better chance of making an impact, capturing attention, transmitting their ideas and being remembered.

## Can I use any stock image?

We cannot use any photograph we find on the Internet just because you like it for your [website, blog](https://polax.co.uk/blog/why-you-need-a-website-for-your-business) or social media profiles.

Make sure you always use royalty-free images. Make sure you read the terms and conditions for images and photos before using them.

For some photos, we can do whatever we want with them for free, but for others, they may not be allowed to be modified or used for commercial purposes. We may even have to cite the photographer.

## Tips for utilizing stock photos

Before you start downloading images, here are some tips to improve your results when you decide to use them.

- Choose images that have a similar style, this will help create a consistent graphic identity; if possible, choose images from the same designer or photographer.
- If you do not have extensive knowledge of graphic design, then you can opt for .png and .jpg formats, you can vary sizes but not formats.
- Use Drive or Dropbox to create a project or folder to manage new resources if you want to organize them better.
- You need to remember to rename your graphics resources every time you add them to your website, and include keywords in all files to boost [search engine rankings](https://polax.co.uk/blog/common-seo-mistakes-you-need-to-avoid).
- Download all the files you require a few hours in advance, so you can stay focused and have a small batch of images at hand.
- You need to familiarize yourself with the licences that you find, so you understand to what extent they can restrict you.

Now that we know which images to use and how to get the most out of them, let’s get into the websites that we recommend to find free stock photos for your business.
