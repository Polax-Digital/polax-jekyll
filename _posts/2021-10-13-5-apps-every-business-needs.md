Small business owners have to wear all the hats in their company, and this can bring a lot of frustration if you donâ€™t have the proper tools to help you out.

Accountant, designer, developerâ€¦ thereâ€™s not enough time in the day to handle everything by yourself. There are a lot of apps that will help you with marketing, task management, schedules and more.

Finding the right ones for your small business can be hard, and thatâ€™s why we are making this article to recommend 5 applications we believe every business owner needs to use.

## **Canva**

Canva is a game changer for most businesses without an in-house design team. This app will provide you with templates for social media, presentations and high-quality materials for you to use.

Stock photos, videos, illustrations, music and the list goes on. The best part about Canva is that you can even design your own templates, upload your brand colour palette, logos and fonts to make everything look consistent.

The paid version adds a lot of extra functionalities, but the free one is **more than enough** for small business that are starting out.

## **Fiverr**

We already mentioned not having time for every little detail on your business when your team is small.

Fiverr is a platform where you can hire contractors at affordable prices that provide all kinds of services, from web design and development to content marketing and SEM campaigns.

Of course, it would be better to hire specialized teams in those fields, but that is not something everyone can afford when starting their own business.

## **Trello**

Trello is a free task management tool that will help you organize your business so you never miss a beat.

Using your phone for to-do lists it's fine, but that can get messy real quick as time goes on. Just imagine yourself trying to organize months of tasks on your phone mixed with grocery shopping lists and personal notes.

We prefer Trello to other kanban tools because it's easier to work with a team and their free plan it's quite generous.

## **Squarespace**

We already gave you [7 reasons why your business needs a website](https://polax.co.uk/blog/why-you-need-a-website-for-your-business), but making it by yourself can be hard.

Squarespace gives you a visual editor so you can create your own website without writing a single line of code.

This is the only tool on the list that doesnâ€™t have a free plan, and the cheapest option starts at Â£10 per month.

However, if you want a website tailored to your business needs that will make you stand out, feel free to [reach out](https://polax.co.uk/contact) to us so we can talk. ðŸ˜„

## **Linktree**

Linktree provides you with a landing page that hosts multiple links in order to drive traffic to specific areas of your business, maybe a newsletter form, the latest Instagram post you made or your Facebook page.

They also give you the option to collect payments, provide analytics to see which links are the most used and have third-party integrations to extend their functionality.

The free version of Linktree have more than enough themes, so you should not have the need to upgrade anytime soon to one of their paid plans.

And thatâ€™s all for now! We want to write more in depth articles about some of these apps to help small business owners, and hope you found at least one new tool that will be of use to you.
